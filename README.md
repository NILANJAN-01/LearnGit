How Git works internally under the hood?

1. ✅ What Is Git?
Git is a distributed version control system (VCS) designed to:

Track changes in source code

Allow safe collaboration across teams

Manage branches, versions, and the history of a project

Key Features:
Distributed: Every developer has a full copy of the project history.

Fast: Most operations are local.

Reliable: Git uses cryptographic hashing (SHA-1) to ensure integrity.

Branching/Merging: Git makes branching easy and cheap.


2. 🛠️ What Happens When You Install Git?
On Windows (git.exe)
Installs Git binaries (git.exe, git.cmd, etc.).

Adds Git tools to your system PATH (e.g., git, bash, ssh).

Optionally installs:

Git Bash (a Unix-like shell)

Git GUI (a visual Git client)

Sets up default configuration directories:

C:\Program Files\Git\

C:\Users\<YourName>\.gitconfig (global config)

On Linux (sudo apt install git)
Installs Git to system paths like /usr/bin/git

Makes Git accessible from any terminal


3. 🚀 What Happens When You Run git init?
Command:

bash
Copy
Edit
git init
Effect:

Initializes an empty Git repository in your project.

Creates a hidden .git/ folder that contains everything Git needs to track changes in your project.

Doesn’t track any files until you explicitly add them (git add).


4. 🗂️ What Is the Folder Structure Inside .git?
arduino
Copy
Edit
.git/
├── HEAD
├── config
├── description
├── hooks/
├── info/
├── objects/
├── refs/
│   ├── heads/
│   └── tags/


5. 📄 File-by-File Breakdown of .git
.git/HEAD
Points to the current branch you’re on:

bash
Copy
Edit
ref: refs/heads/master
Meaning: "You're on branch master."

.git/config
Stores local repository settings:

ini
Copy
Edit
[core]
    repositoryformatversion = 0
    filemode = true
    bare = false
.git/description
Human-readable repo description.

Used by Git web interfaces (e.g., GitWeb).

Ignored by the Git CLI.

.git/hooks/
Contains scripts that run at various Git lifecycle events:

pre-commit, pre-push, post-merge, etc.

Sample scripts are provided with .sample extension.

.git/info/
Contains exclude, which works like .gitignore, but is local-only and not version-controlled.

.git/objects/
This is Git's content-addressable object database.

Stores all data (blobs, trees, commits, tags).

Organized using SHA-1 hashes:

bash
Copy
Edit
.git/objects/e6/87db1a6a0d3b4878f6d7bc3b61fdb3b88f263a
Git Object Types:
Type	Description
blob	File content
tree	A directory (points to blobs and trees)
commit	A snapshot with metadata (points to a tree)
tag	A named pointer to a commit

Git doesn’t store diffs — it stores complete snapshots indexed by SHA-1.

.git/refs/
Stores references (pointers) to commit objects.

.git/refs/heads/
One file per local branch (e.g., master)

Each file contains the SHA-1 of the latest commit on that branch

.git/refs/tags/
Contains references to specific commits tagged with names

[Optional] .git/branches/
Legacy; rarely used in modern Git

6. 🔍 How Git Works Internally Under the Hood
🔑 Content-Addressable Filesystem
Git stores data by content, not by name or location.

Each piece of content is hashed using SHA-1.

Files, directories, commits — all are saved as immutable objects.

📦 Git Object Types Recap
Object	Description
blob	Contents of a file
tree	Directory; maps names to blobs/trees
commit	Points to a tree; includes author, message, and parent commits
tag	A human-readable name pointing to a commit

🧬 Example Flow
You create a file:

bash
Copy
Edit
echo "Hello Git" > hello.txt
You run:

bash
Copy
Edit
git add hello.txt
Internally:

Git creates a blob with the file content.

Computes its SHA-1 hash and saves it in .git/objects/.

You commit:

bash
Copy
Edit
git commit -m "First commit"
Internally:

Git creates a tree for the current directory.

Creates a commit object that points to the tree.

Updates the branch reference (refs/heads/master) with the new commit hash.

                     ↓
          (git commit) → Tree → Commit → refs


🧠 SHA-1: The Core of Git
Git uses SHA-1 to:

Name objects (blobs, trees, commits, tags)

Ensure data integrity

Avoid duplication (same content = same hash)

Even a 1-character change in a file leads to a completely different SHA-1.
